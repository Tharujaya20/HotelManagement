The hotel management system is a free and open-source project. This application is pretty simple and easy to use. 
The whole system is built in Java programming language with the help of NetBeans IDE. Also to make records available for future use its back-end is the SQLite database. 
This is a simple yet complete hotel management system. This system performs all the necessary tasks that a hotel software application performs.

About The System

Talking about the system, it lacks one basic thing which is the login panel for the administrator. 
You can simply add the login panel to make it more secure and private. The system is all from the admin side. 
Admin has full access to the system. The user can only book and reserve hotel rooms. 
The user can either book a room that is paid for, reserve the room for later confirmation, or simply book rooms. 
After that, then the user can make payments and the admin and the application generates the payment invoice.

Not only this the admin can easily add rooms and its services types. The admin can create many other facilities required for the guests in a hotel. 
Also, the user can book other miscellaneous activities in the hotel booking system. As a whole, this system is very effective and user-friendly.
